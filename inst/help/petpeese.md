PET-PEESE
===

PET-PEESE is a meta-analytic method based on weighted least squares. Instead of the classical (random or fixed) meta-analyses that assume additive heterogeneity, PET-PEESE assumes multiplicative heterogeneity. Furthermore, PET and PEESE incorporate different adjustments of selection processes. See Carter et al. (2019) for an overview of the methods.

- PET adjusts for selection processes by adjusting for the relationship between effect sizes and standard errors (Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2014; Stanley, 2017).
- PEESE adjusts for selection processes by adjusting for the relationship between effect sizes and standard errors squared (Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2014; Stanley, 2017).

PET-PEESE is usually used as conditional estimator. PET is used to test for the presence of the effect size with alpha = 0.10. If the PET's test for effect size is significant, PEESE effect size estimate is interpreted, if PET's test for effect size is not significant, the PET's effect size estimate is interpreted (Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2014; Stanley, 2017).

### Input
---
#### Input type
- Effect sizes & SE: Specifying input using any other types of effect sizes and standard errors.
- Correlations & N: Specifying input using correlations and the sample size. Note that the effect size is internally transformed to Fisher's z scale for model estimation. The summarized output is transformed back to correlations.

#### Data
- Effect Size: Effect sizes of the studies.
- Effect Size Standard Error: Standard errors of the effect sizes per study. Must always be positive.
- N: Overall sample sizes of the studies. Only possible if the supplied effect sizes are correlations.
- Transform correlations: Type of transformation to be applied prior to estimating models when correlation coefficients are supplied as input. The estimates and figures display mean estimates transformed back to the correlation scale (apart from the meta-regression estimates for the standard error /standard errors squared).


### Inference
