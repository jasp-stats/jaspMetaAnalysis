Bayesian Meta-Analysis
===

Bayesian meta-analysis allows the user to estimate an overall effect size estimate from multiple studies and test whether the effect size estimate deviates from zero. 

### Input
---

#### Data
- Effect Size: Effect size of the studies. 
- Effect Size Standard Error: Standard errors of the effect sizes per study. Must always be positive. A 95% CI for the effect sizes can be provided instead. 
- 95% CI Lower and Upper Bound: 95% CI lower and upper bound of the effect sizes per study. Must be separated into two columns. The standard errors of the effect sizes can be provided instead.
- Study Labels: Optional. Will add study labels to 'Effect sizes per study' table and the (cumulative) forest plot.

#### Model
- Fixed effects: performs a fixed effects Bayesian meta-analysis.
- Random effects: performs a random effects Bayesian meta-analysis.
- Model averaged: performs a model averaged Bayesian meta-analysis. Averages over the fixed and random effects models. Fixed and random effects results are also given. 
- Constrained random effects
  - All postive: performs a constrained random effects Bayesian meta-analysis, where the effect size estimates are constrained to be postive. 
  - All negative: performs a constrained random effects Bayesian meta-analysis, where the effect size estimates are constrained to be negative. 

#### Bayes Factor
- BF<sub>10</sub>: By selecting this option, the Bayes factor will show evidence for the alternative hypothesis relative to the null hypothesis. This option is selected by default.
- BF<sub>01</sub>: By selecting this option, the Bayes factor will show evidence for the null hypothesis relative to the alternative hypothesis. This is equal to 1/BF<sub>10</sub>.
- Log(BF<sub>10</sub>): By selecting this option, the natural logarithm of BF<sub>10</sub>, BF<sub>m</sub>, BF<sub>Inclusion</sub>, BF<sub>10, U</sub> will be displayed in the output.

### Table

#### Prior and posterior
Displays the prior and posterior distribution of the effect size/heterogeneity under the alternative hypothesis. 

- Additional info:
  - Effect size: Adds the Bayes factor computed with the user-defined prior; adds a probability wheel depicting the odds of the data under the null hypothesis vs. an alternative hypothesis; adds the mean and the 95% credible interval of the posterior distribution of the effect size.
  - Heterogeneity: Adds the Bayes factor computed with the user-defined prior; adds a probability wheel depicting the odds of the data under random effects H<sub>1</sub> (& H<sub>0</sub> for model averaging) vs. fixed effects H<sub>1</sub> (& H<sub>0</sub> for model averaging); adds the mean and the 95% credible interval of the posterior distribution of the effect size.
- Add fixed and random effects posterior: Adds the posterior density functions of the fixed and random effects models.
- Shade 95% CI: Colour the 95% CI in the posterior density function.

#### Sequential plot
