Robust Bayesian Meta-Analysis
===

The robust Bayesian meta-analysis allows the user to specify a wide range of meta-analytic models, combine their estimates using model averaging and quantify evidence for different hypotheses using Bayes factors. The analysis allows the user to specify various prior distributions for effect sizes and heterogeneity and incorporate models correcting for publication bias by estimating a weight function on p-values. 

### Input
---
#### Input type
- Cohen's d / t-statistics & N / SE: Specifying input using either Cohen's d effect sizes and the sample size or standard errors, or reported t-statistics and sample sizes.
- Correlations & N: Specifying input using correlations and the sample size. Note that the effect size is internally transformed to Cohen's d scale for model estimation (see Advanced tab for additional options). The prior distributions are specified on the transformed scale, with the provided visualization transforming the priors back to the correlation scale. The output for the mean parameter is transformed back for easier interpretability, however, the heterogeneity parameter is always summarized on the transformed scale.
- Odds ratios & CI: Specifying input using odds rations and their confidence intervals. Note that the effect size is internally transformed to log odds ratios for model estimation (see Advanced tab for additional options). The prior distributions are specified on the transformed scale, with the provided visualization transforming the priors back to the correlation scale. Analyzing odds ratios is an experimental feature and the default prior distributions were not verified to work with them. The output for the mean parameter is transformed back for easier interpretability, however, the heterogeneity parameter is always summarized on the transformed scale.
- Effect sizes & SE: Specifying input using any other types of effect sizes and standard errors. Note that effect sizes supplied in this way will result in approximating the corresponding test statistics distribution using a normal distribution.
- Fitted model: Specify a path to already fitted RoBMA model using R. The model must be saved as an RDS file.

#### Data
- Effect Size: Effect sizes of the studies. In case that the effect sizes are measured by Cohen's d t-statistics can be provided instead.
- t-statistic: t-statistics of the studies. Only possible if the studies effect sizes are measured by Cohen's d or correlations. Effect sizes can be provided instead. 
- Effect Size Standard Error: Standard errors of the effect sizes per study. Must always be positive. A 95% CI for the effect sizes can be provided instead. In case that the effect sizes are measured by Cohen's d the sample sizes can be provided instead.
- 95% CI Lower and Upper Bound: 95% CI lower and upper bounds of the effect sizes per study. Must be separated into two columns. The standard errors of the effect sizes can be provided instead.
- N: Overall sample sizes of the studies. Only possible if the studies effect sizes are measured by Cohen's d or correlations. Effect Size Standard Errors can be provided instead. In the case of two-sample t-tests, sample sizes per group can be provided as well.
- N (group 1) / N (group 2): Sample sizes of each group of the studies. Only possible if the studies effect sizes are measured by Cohen's d and correspond to two-sample t-tests. Overall sample sizes or Effect Size Standard Errors can be provided instead.
- Study Labels: Optional argument that will add study labels to the output.

#### Input test type
Only for 'Cohen's d / t-statistics & (N / SE)' input type. 


### Models
---
The individual models that form up the robust Bayesian meta-analysis are defined by creating combinations of all specified priors for the effect size / heterogeneity / publication bias. The individual models' prior odds are obtained by multiplying the prior odds of prior distributions for each of the parameter that forms the model. Note that the prior distributions for the mean parameter are transformed into the correlation scale using a selected transformation if correlations are supplied as input.

#### Expected effect size direction
The direction of the expected effect size (the publication bias adjusted models with one-sided selection processes are not symmetrical around zero due to the estimation of weights).

#### Plot priors
Displays the specified prior density function(s).

#### Effect / Heterogeneity
Set a prior distribution(s) for the Effect size or heterogeneity.
- Distribution: Name and parametrization of the distribution.
  - Normal(μ,σ): Normal distribution parametrized by mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).
  - Student's t(μ,σ,v): Generalized Student's t distribution parametrized by location (μ), scale (σ), and degrees of freedom (v).
  - Cauchy(x₀,θ): Cauchy distribution parametrized by location (μ) and scale (σ).
  - Gamma(α,β): Gamma distribution parametrized by shape (α) and rate (β).
  - Gamma(k,θ): Gamma distribution parametrized by shape (k) and scale (θ).
  - Inverse-Gamma(α,β): Inverse-Gamma distribution parametrized by shape (α) and scale (β).
  - Spike(x₀): Point density parametrized by location (x₀).
  - Uniform(a,b): Uniform distribution parametrized by lower bound (a) and upper bound (b).
- Parameters: Values for parameters of the selected distribution.

#### Publication bias
Set a prior distribution(s) for the parameters of the weight function modeling the publication bias. α α₁ α₂ p-values
- Distribution: Name and parametrization of the distribution.
    - Two-sided: Prior distribution for a two-sided weight function characterized by vector of cut points on p-values (p-values) and vector alpha (α). The vector alpha (α) determines an alpha parameter of Dirichlet distribution which cumulative sum is used for the weights omega. The first element of α corresponds to the weight for the highest p-value interval.
  - One-sided (mon.): Prior distribution for a monotonic one-sided weight function characterized by vector of cut points on p-values (p-values) and vector alpha (α). The vector alpha (α) determines the alpha parameter of Dirichlet distribution which cumulative sum is used for the weights omega. The first element of α corresponds to the weight for the highest p-value interval.
  - One-sided: Prior distribution for a non-monotonic one-sided weight function characterized by vector of cut points on p-values (p-values) and two vectors alpha (α₁ α₂). The vectors alpha (α₁ α₂) determine the alpha parameters of Dirichlet distribution which cumulative sum is used for the weights omega - α₁ determines the omegas for p-value intervals starting at = .50 and decreasing and α₂ determines the omegas for p-value intervals = .50 and increasing.
  - None: Prior distribution assuming complete lack of publication bias - the probability of publication is the same for all p-values.

#### Exclude models
Allows excluding individual models from the overall ensemble based on MCMC diagnostics.
- error %: All models whose parameters have MCMC error higher than the specified value will be excluded.
- R-hat: All models whose parameters have R-hat error higher than the specified value will be excluded.
- Estimated sample site %: All models whose parameters have smaller estimated sample sizes lower than the specified value will be excluded.
- Include theta: Whether random effect estimates theta should be included in the considered parameters.

#### Redistribute prior probability
Allows respecifying how should be the prior probabilities of individual models changed in case that some of them fail to converge.
- Conditional models: The prior model probability of a non-converged model will be transferred to a model with the same the type of priors if possible. Meaning that if there are two models with non-null prior on effect size, heterogeneity, and publication bias and one of them fails to converge, the other one will gain the prior probability of the non-converged one. If there is no such model, the prior probability will be redistributed equally across all models.
- Model space: If there is a non-converged model, the prior probability will be redistributed equally across all models.

#### Control
Allows modifying the fitting and refitting behavior of the analysis when 'Run Analysis' is clicked.
- Clever refitting: The whole ensemble is refitted only if prior distributions change, otherwise, only the non-converged models are refitted.
- Always refit: Always refits the whole ensemble.
- Never refit: Never refits the ensemble or the individual models.

#### Repeatability
- Set seed: Gives the option to set a seed for your analysis. Setting a seed will exclude random processes influencing an analysis.
