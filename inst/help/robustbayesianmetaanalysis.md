Robust Bayesian Meta-Analysis
===

The robust Bayesian meta-analysis allows the user to specify a wide range of meta-analytic models, combine their estimates using model averaging, and quantify evidence for different hypotheses using Bayes factors. The analysis allows the user to specify various prior distributions for effect sizes and heterogeneity and incorporate models correcting for publication bias with selection models and PET-PEESE. 

Please note that we updated the model specification of RoBMA models with the version of JASP 0.15 (the analysis is now built on RoBMA 2.0 package). See our new RoBMA preprint for more details (https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/kvsp7).

### Input
---
The input supplied as standardized effect sizes are internally transformed to Fisher's z statistics (as a variance stabilizing transformation). The results are shown the same scale that is used to specify the prior distributions (Cohen's d by default, can be changed only for the "Custom" `model type`.)

#### Input type
- Cohen's d: Specifying input using either Cohen's d effect sizes and the sample size or standard errors.
- Correlations: Specifying input using correlations and the sample size or standard errors. 
- Log odds ratios: Specifying input using log odds ratios and the standard errors.
- General effect sizes & SE: Specifying input using any other, unstandardized, types of effect sizes and the corresponding standard errors. 
- Fitted model: Specify a path to already fitted RoBMA model using R. The model must be saved as an RDS file.

#### Data
- Effect Size: Effect sizes of the studies. In case that the effect sizes are measured by Cohen's d t-statistics can be provided instead.
- t-statistic: t-statistics of the studies. Only possible if the studies effect sizes are measured by Cohen's d or correlations. Effect sizes can be provided instead. 
- Effect Size Standard Error: Standard errors of the effect sizes per study. Must always be positive. A 95% CI for the effect sizes can be provided instead. In case that the effect sizes are measured by Cohen's d the sample sizes can be provided instead.
- 95% CI Lower and Upper Bound: 95% CI lower and upper bounds of the effect sizes per study. Must be separated into two columns. The standard errors of the effect sizes can be provided instead.
- N: Overall sample sizes of the studies. Only possible if the studies effect sizes are measured by Cohen's d or correlations. Effect Size Standard Errors can be provided instead. In the case of two-sample t-tests, sample sizes per group can be provided as well.
- N (group 1) / N (group 2): Sample sizes of each group of the studies. Only possible if the studies effect sizes are measured by Cohen's d and correspond to two-sample t-tests. Overall sample sizes or Effect Size Standard Errors can be provided instead.
- Study Labels: Optional argument that will add study labels to the output.

#### Expected effect size direction
The direction of the expected effect size (the publication bias adjusted models with one-sided weight functions and PET-PEESE publication bias adjustments are not symmetrical around zero).

#### Model type
Either one of the three pre-specified model types corresponding to the models introduced in Bartoš et al. (2021) and Maier, Bartoš & Wagenmakers (in press), or a custom ensemble.
- RoBMA-PSMA corresponds to the 36 model ensemble that combines selection models and PET-PEESE adjustment for publication bias adjustment component (from Bartoš et al., 2021)
- RoBMA-PP corresponds to the 12 model ensemble that uses PET-PEESE adjustment for publication bias adjustment component (from Bartoš et al., 2021)
- RoBMA-old corresponds to the 12 model ensemble that uses two two-sided weight functions for publication bias adjustment component (from Maier, Bartoš & Wagenmakers, in press)
- Custom allows specifying a custom model ensemble under the `Models` section

#### Prior scale

### Models

The individual models that form up the robust Bayesian meta-analysis are defined by creating combinations of all specified priors for the effect size/heterogeneity/publication bias. The individual models' prior odds are obtained by multiplying the prior odds of prior distributions for each of the parameter that forms the model.

- MCMC error: The target MCMC error of parameter estimates for terminating the automatic estimation procedure (note that PEESE regression coefficient has usually much larger scale than the rest of the ensemble and using this option might significantly prolong the fitting time).
- MCMC error / SD: The target MCMC error standardized by the standard deviation of the posterior distribution of parameter estimates for terminating the automatic estimation procedure.
- Maximum fitting time: The maximum fitting time per model.
- Extend samples: The number of samples to be added on each autofit iteration.
